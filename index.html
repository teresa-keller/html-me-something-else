            <h2>MaxMax</h2>
            <p>My son, Maxwell Broderick Keller, was born on April 12, 2001. He is my only child. He graduated from high school in May 2018. Max and I love to play video games together, especially Mario games. We also like to go walking around parks and playing Pokemon Go.</p>

            <h2>Vader</h2>
            <p>My family adopted Vader from the Humane Society on January 20, 2007. The Humane Society estimated his age at one and a half when we adopted him. That means our little Vader is almost sixteen years old. Vader is a miniature pinscher/chihuahua mix. He loves food and cuddling with his family.</p>
